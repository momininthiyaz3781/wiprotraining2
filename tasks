task 5: Breadth-First Search (BFS) Implementation
For a given undirected graph, implement BFS to traverse the graph starting from a given node and print each node in the order it is visited.
 
Task 6: Depth-First Search (DFS) Recursive
Write a recursive DFS function for a given undirected graph. The function should visit every node and print it out.
