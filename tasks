task 5: Breadth-First Search (BFS) Implementation
For a given undirected graph, implement BFS to traverse the graph starting from a given node and print each node in the order it is visited.
 
Task 6: Depth-First Search (DFS) Recursive
Write a recursive DFS function for a given undirected graph. The function should visit every node and print it out.

Task 3: Union-Find for Cycle Detection
Write a Union-Find data structure with path compression. Use this data structure to detect a cycle in an undirected graph.

Task 1: Dijkstra’s Shortest Path Finder
Code Dijkstra’s algorithm to find the shortest path from a start node to every other node in a weighted graph with positive weights.
